# 👋 Hi, I'm Kulamani Pradhan 🛡️

### **Software Engineer | SecOps & Cloud Security | Ethical Hacker by Passion**

I am a security-focused Software Engineer who bridges the gap between **Offensive (Red Team)** curiosity and **Defensive (Blue Team)** excellence. By day, I build and secure large-scale systems; by night, I explore ethical hacking to stay ahead of modern threats.

---

## 🚀 Professional Focus
Currently, I am deep in the world of **Cloud Security** and **SecOps**, focusing on:
* **Google Chronicle:** Scaling security telemetry and threat detection at planet-scale.
* **SIEM & Log Analysis:** Expert-level data interrogation using **Splunk** and **Netforest**.
* **Defensive Engineering:** Building robust architectures that are "secure by design."

## 🛠️ Technical Toolbox

| Category | Technologies & Tools |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Security & SIEM** | Google Chronicle, Splunk, Netforest, SecOps, Ethical Hacking |
| **Backend & Logic** | Java, Python, Bash Scripting |
| **Frontend** | React.js, JavaScript |
| **Infrastructure** | Cloud Security, CI/CD, Linux Hardening |

## 🧪 The "Purple Team" Edge
I believe the best defense is informed by an understanding of the offense.
* **Scripting for Security:** I use **Python** and **Bash** to automate repetitive security tasks, parse complex logs, and build custom security tooling.
* **Full-Stack Security:** My experience with **React**, **Java**, and **Python** allows me to secure applications from the UI down to the database level.
* **Threat Hunting:** Leveraging my passion for ethical hacking to proactively find and fix vulnerabilities before they are exploited.

## 🌱 Current Goals
- ⚡ Refining automated detection and response workflows.
- 🏗️ Building secure-by-default microservices.
- 🔒 Deepening my expertise in Cloud Native Security.
